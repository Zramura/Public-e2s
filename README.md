for any files in the advdupe2 folder the steps to load them into garry's mod is the following

Step 1: Right click Garry's Mod in your Steam library, then click properties.

Step 2: Click Installed Files (3rd from the top), and then click Browse Local files. It should pull up "File Explorer" for Windows users.

Step 3: Go into the folder "garrysmod"

Step 4: Some people then go straight to addons. WRONG! You'll be stuck there for days trying to find the files. Instead, go into "data"

Step 5: There, it's obvious. Advanced Duplicator 2 is the folder "advdupe2"

this is how u find where to put the file when u download the file make sure to click the "raw" link
